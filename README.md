# testRepo
This is used for a testing the functionality of Serverless Orchestrator.

In this repo is a very basic example of a Product Service microservice using Go and the Gin web framework for routing and handling HTTP requests. This will provide endpoints to fetch all products, fetch a specific product by ID, and add a new product.

## To Run It
To run this, you would need to install Go and Gin (go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin), then you can simply run go run main.go inside the product-service directory, and the service will start on port 8080.
